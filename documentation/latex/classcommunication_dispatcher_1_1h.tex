Class used to connect nodes.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$communication\+Dispatcher.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Class used to connect nodes. 

The system is organized in a star formation with the \hyperlink{namespacecommunication_dispatcher}{communication\+Dispatcher} in the midle. All nodes are connected to the \hyperlink{namespacecommunication_dispatcher}{communication\+Dispatcher} and send messages to each other through the \hyperlink{namespacecommunication_dispatcher}{communication\+Dispatcher}. Using this star formation graph instead of a complete graph reduces the number of communication channels from N$^\wedge$2 channels to N channels, which particularly reduces the simulation\textquotesingle{}s initialization time.

The \hyperlink{namespacecommunication_dispatcher}{communication\+Dispatcher} routes messages to the destination, handles the broadcast of application messages, and sets the propagation delays of messages. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
